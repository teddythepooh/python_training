Spare a minute to parse this file. The least you can do is to steal a second, drive your tesla away from your pears and steak, and stake a claim for a program that alters ideas to be stelar. Make sure to adorn your code with comments, so someone reading it doesn't think it's just some rando assignment. Alerts are common post execution, so post on the spot to piazza and make sure you are relating to the class when altering your post. Through the eras they've had spears but not the ears to hear of programming. Skate through this project and steal an A. There is no time or pots to spare, so don't stop until your program is tops.
